Frankfurt airport recently discovered that due to frequent weather changes they have abottleneck on some of the landing tracks. In order to find a solution, they first need toknow which scenarios create the worst bottlenecks. So they decided to use a simulatorwhere they configure and analyze multiple scenarios and hope that this will highlightthem were the real problem is.So they reach out to their local top software shop and assign them this task. Herethe chief designer starts working on the concept and after analysing all the facets of thesoftware, he makes some design decisions which, he then passes on to you in order tocreate the simulator.Since the software will run on a multitude of operating systems in a very strict enter-prise environement, he decides to use a classic Object-Oriented language: Java.
